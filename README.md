# Translator-using-transfomers
In this repository, you can find an implementation of the Transfomer method from scratch, using Python as a programming language and TensorFlow as deep learning framework.
For this implementation, the selected application was a translator which translates sentences from English to Spanish. This use case is very illustrative as it allows to show the potential of Transformers to address end-to-end problems.
The code is properly documented, but if you want to dive deep in the theory behind Transfomers, please go to the original researc paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762.pdf
